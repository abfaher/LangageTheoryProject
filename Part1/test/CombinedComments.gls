$ Simple IF execution :

    IF $ this comment should be ignored..
    
    !! Test to ignore : 

    Finally, comments are allowed in GILLES. There are two kinds of comments: Short comments, which are
    all the symbols appearing after a dollar sign $ up to the end of the line, and long comments, which are all the
    symbols occurring between two double exclamation marks .. keywords. There is no possibility of nested
    comments. Observe that comments do not occur in the rules of the grammar: they must be ignored by the
    scanner, and will not be transmitted to the parser.
